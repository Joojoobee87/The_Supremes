<h1>The Supremes</h1>

<p>

The Supremes are a 1960s Soul and Motown group who’ve had profound success over the past few decades. Now back on tour after over 50 years, they needed a platform on which to showcase all of their existing and new material and to publicise the dates of their upcoming tour: “The Supremes: Sublime Soul and Motown”. 

<h2>UX</h2>

The primary audience is The Supremes fan base across the globe. The group also wanted to attract the interest of younger audiences and inspire the next generation of budding Soul stars.

The following were listed as main requirements for the site:
<ul><li>Fans as the primary target audience
<li>Visual and audio clips from the groups back catalogue
<li>New material as it becomes available
</ul>

In terms of the US design, the following user stories are pertinent:
<ul><li>As a user, I want to find out more about the group. I want pictures and summary details in order to digest quickly before continuing my navigation around the site.
<li>As a user, I want to know more about the members of the group including images and information about each band member.
<li>As a user, I want to experience a taste of The Supremes in action utilising my visual and audio senses
<li>As a user, I want to be able to find out more about the band and follow them via social media platforms
<li>As a user, I want to find out about when and where the band are touring/performing so that I can see them in action
<li>As an event manager/marketer/organiser, I want to be able to get in contact to find out about booking events
<li>As a band member, I want to publicise my social media platforms so that I can grow my fan base and inspire people through music
<li>As a band member, I want event managers/marketers/organisers to be able to get in contact to enquire about booking events
<li>As a band member, I want fans to know about my tour in order to sell tickets.
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>

The site is fully responsive giving users the best visual display of content dependent on the device it is being viewed from. The navigation and footer bars are consistent throughout the project allowing users to easily navigate to where they want to go and offers a quick summary of the type of information they are going to find without having to first navigate through the site.

Key features of the site include:

<h3>Feature 1: Main navigation bar</h3>
The navigation bar has a responsive design and is styled consistently throughout the project. It offers users as quick visual summary of what information can be found and allows easy navigation between pages

<h3>Feature 2: Footer links</h3>
The footer bar also has a responsive design and is styled to mirror the navigation bar providing users with clear differentiation between the different sections on the page. The footer contains Bootstrap styled social media links which take users directly to the relevant page on that platform

<h3>Feature 3: The Supremes - homepage</h3>
The landing page has been designed to showcase some of the most iconic images of The Supremes across the top row of the section. 
Audio clip…..
A summary of the groups history follows but kept brief to ensure that user interest is maintained and they digest some information before continuing navigation through the site.

<h3>Feature 4: Members</h3>
The Members page gives the user information about who the current band members are including an image and short summary about the person. The responsive design shows the text beneath the image for smaller devices. The page is split into two sections with current band members at the top and a subsequent section giving information about previous band members.

<h3>Feature 5: Albums</h3>
The Albums page has a simple design in which to display some of The Supremes albums, using the original album cover as the displayed image. A hover class has been applied to supply the user with a track listing of the songs on that album and contains an external link so when the user clicks onto the album, they are taken to the relevant page on Spotify where they can buy/download the album.

<h3>Feature 6: Hits</h3>
The Hits page contains a summary of The Supremes top No. 1 hits including the track name, a brief summary about it, and an embedded YouTube video link which can be played in the browser - track played at the users discretion. On larger browsers, the page also offers snippets of lyrics taken from some of their top hits, helping users to further engage with the band and their songs.

<h3>Feature 7: Tour</h3>
The Tour page gives the user a tabular representation of all tour dates and venues in ascending order (by date). There is a button which takes the user to the Ticket Master site (NB: no dates available due to fictional nature of this project).

<h3>Feature 8: Contact</h3>
The basic contact form provides the ability for users to send a message. At the moment, this form is not functional as the project only covers front end design using HTML5 and CSS3 and so is for display purposes only.

<h3>Feature 9: Privacy</h3>
It is important that users understand how their information will be used, particularly in light of the latest updates to legislation including the recent EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the most important change in data privacy regulation in 20 years. Lorem Ipsum text has been entered as dummy text in place of where the privacy policy text would be staged.

<h3>Features Left to Implement</h3>
Apply functional design to the contact form so that users data can be submitted
Add JavaScript coding to make the site more interactive for users
Add new html page for fan mail and to allow users to comment, feedback on all aspects from tour to events to music and more.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

The following technologies were used throughout the design, build and implementation stages:

<h3>Balsamiq</h3>
https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/
<p>Allows designers and developers to sketch out designs and collaborate on projects of all sizes. The software allows the project designers and developers to focus on the ‘Skeleton’ phase of the User Experience Design process and not become distracted by the finer details covered on the Surface Plane. The Balsamiq wireframes created for this project can be found in the wireframes folder here:
https://github.com/Joojoobee87/The_Supremes</p>

<h3>Cloud9</h3>
https://c9.io/
<p>Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) which was used to write, run, and debug the code for this project.</p>

<h3>HTML5</h3>
HTML5 is the coding language used for the basic structure of the website, defining the elements, attributes and behaviours of the web pages.

<h3>CSS3</h3>
CSS3 is used to style the elements used within the website including layout, sizing, color, decoration etc.

<h3>Bootstrap v3.3.7</h3>
https://getbootstrap.com
Bootstrap Framework has been used for some of the design features of the website. In particular, Bootstraps Grid system has been utilised for the navigation bar, footer and throughout various sections in order to optimise the layout dependent on the users viewport, enhancing user experience on mobile devices. Bootstrap Forms and Tables have also been used as a basis for some of the features including the contact form and the tour dates and venues.

<h3>GitHub Repository</h3>

<h2>Deployment</h2>

Cloud9 IDE was used to build the HTML5 and CSS3 code. Files were added, committed and pushed to the remote GitHub repository periodically throughout the build. Test.html and Test.css files were utilised to test some coding prior to building in the main html pages. Bootstrap coding was used and referred back to, to provide clarification on the function of the coding and to ensure that coding was not duplicated in the style.css file.

All files used in the project can be found on the GitHub repository page below:
